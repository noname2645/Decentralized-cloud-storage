☁️ Decentralized Cloud Storage
🔰 Description
Decentralized Cloud Storage is a web application that allows users to securely upload and retrieve files using blockchain technology. Each uploaded file is stored on IPFS and registered as a unique asset on the blockchain, ensuring data integrity and decentralization.

🚀 Features
File Upload: Users can securely upload files through a user-friendly interface.

Asset Creation: Each uploaded file generates a unique asset on the blockchain, associated with its IPFS address.

File Retrieval: Users can retrieve uploaded files based on the blockchain records.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js, CSS

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Blockchain: Ethereum Smart Contracts (Solidity)

Storage: InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)
